# WiFi Analyzer

WiFi Analyzer is a project designed to analyze Wi-Fi networks using Python for data collection and processing, with Docker ensuring a consistent runtime environment across different systems.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to assess the quality of Wi-Fi networks by measuring signal strength, identifying optimal channels, and evaluating network congestion. With these insights, users can make informed decisions to improve network performance.

### Key Features

- **Signal Strength Analysis**: Measures Wi-Fi signal strength in dBm to assess connection quality and distance from access points.
- **Channel Analysis**: Identifies available Wi-Fi channels and recommends the least congested ones for better connectivity.
- **Network Congestion Evaluation**: Analyzes network traffic to provide a clearer picture of network load and potential bottlenecks.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Used for data analysis and processing.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistency in the development and runtime environment, simplifying setup and deployment.
